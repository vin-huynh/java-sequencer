# JAVA SEQUENCER
by Vincent Huynh

Java Sequencer is a beautiful 16-step music sequencer I created for a high school project.
It features a wide variety of instruments and drum kits that can be programmed into the sequencer to loop their own or played live with a keyboard, numpad, or mouse.
Full ranges of tempi and octaves are supported.
